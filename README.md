## Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of unemployment trends in India during 2020, with a particular focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Python and advanced data visualization techniques, this study examines unemployment rates across different regions and time periods to provide insights that could inform economic and social policies.

The analysis reveals significant patterns in unemployment data, including the dramatic spike during the lockdown period and the subsequent recovery patterns across different regions of India.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Complete exploration of unemployment data with statistical insights
- **COVID-19 Impact Assessment**: Detailed analysis of pre-COVID vs. during-COVID unemployment patterns
- **Regional Comparison**: Analysis of unemployment trends across different geographical regions
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Both static and interactive charts for better data understanding
- **Trend Identification**: Seasonal and temporal pattern recognition in unemployment data
- **Policy Insights**: Data-driven recommendations for economic policy formulation

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   # If you have the project archive
   tar -xzf unemployment_analysis_project.tar.gz
   cd unemployment_analysis_project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/Unemployment_Analysis.ipynb`)

This notebook consolidates all the analysis steps, from data loading and cleaning to EDA, COVID-19 impact analysis, and visualization. It's the recommended way to explore the project step-by-step.

To open and run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Unemployment_Analysis.ipynb
```

### Python Scripts (for direct execution)

Alternatively, you can run the individual Python scripts:

- **Data Cleaning and Exploration (`src/unemployment_analysis.py`)**:
  This script performs data loading, initial exploration, cleaning, and generates basic visualizations.
  ```bash
  python src/unemployment_analysis.py
  ```

- **COVID-19 Impact Analysis (`src/unemployment_analysis_covid_impact.py`)**:
  This script focuses on pre-COVID vs. during-COVID comparison, regional impact assessment, trend identification, and generates advanced visualizations.
  ```bash
  python src/unemployment_analysis_covid_impact.py
  ```

## Key Findings

### 1. COVID-19 Impact

- **Dramatic Spike**: Unemployment rates peaked in April-May 2020, reaching over 23% on average
- **Regional Variations**: Different regions showed varying degrees of impact and recovery
- **Gradual Recovery**: Post-peak period showed gradual improvement but remained elevated compared to pre-COVID levels

### 2. Regional Analysis

- **Most Affected Regions**: Tripura, Bihar, and Delhi experienced the highest unemployment rates during peak COVID
- **Regional Categories**: Northern and Eastern regions showed higher volatility compared to Southern regions
- **Recovery Patterns**: Some regions recovered faster than others, indicating varying economic resilience

### 3. Temporal Patterns

- **Seasonal Trends**: Clear seasonal patterns emerged, heavily influenced by the pandemic timeline
- **Pre-COVID Stability**: January-February 2020 showed relatively stable unemployment rates
- **Long-term Impact**: Effects persisted through November 2020, indicating lasting economic consequences

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this analysis contains unemployment statistics for Indian states and territories from January to November 2020, including:

- **Temporal Coverage**: Monthly data from January 2020 to November 2020
- **Geographical Coverage**: All major states and union territories of India
- **Key Metrics**: Unemployment rate, employed population, labor participation rate
- **Regional Classification**: States categorized into East, North, Northeast, South, and West regions

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, type conversion, and validation
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Statistical summaries and initial visualizations
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Time-based trend identification and pattern recognition
4. **Regional Analysis**: Comparative analysis across different geographical regions
5. **Impact Assessment**: Before-and-after comparison focusing on COVID-19 effects
6. **Visualization**: Creation of comprehensive charts and interactive elements

## Policy Implications

Based on the analysis, several policy recommendations emerge:

- **Targeted Support**: Focus resources on the most affected regions (Tripura, Bihar, Delhi)
